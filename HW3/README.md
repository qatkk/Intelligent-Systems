# Third Project 
## Neural Networks 
In this project, we tend to build a simple neural network from scratch. By doing so, two major neural network properties, the feedforward, and the backpropagation, are implemented. Ten thousand points train this simple neural network on a sine wave, which is generated to train and test this network. 
Further detail on theoretic aspects and code description, along with the codes for this implementation, can be found in the notebook provided in the same directory.
