# Naive Bayes 
The simplistic Bayesian algorithm is another supervised learning algorithm that has a probabilistic basis. In this algorithm, we consider the strong assumption that the properties of a data are independent, which in most cases is not necessarily the case. Due to the above assumption, we may not be able to use this algorithm most of the time, but they have many applications in other cases, such as probabilistic networks. In this question, we apply this algorithm to the data of wild fungi and based on this, we calculate the probability that each data is toxic or non-toxic.
In this algorithm, we use two types of prior probability and conditional probability to estimate the values of each attribute of a final label data according to the probabilities obtained for each class.
The basis of this algorithm is based on Bayesian theory, which is specified in the following equation.
$$P(A|B) = \frac {P(A,B)}{P(B)}$$
In this way, we first calculate the initial probabilities that the fungi are toxic or non-toxic. These probabilities are reported in the table below.

Next, we calculate the conditional probabilities for each category of attributes and store them in a dictionary.

Conditional probability values are also reported in the code.
We then use these probabilities to predict the values of the test data labels, and assuming the independence of the probability associated with the values of the properties of each test data by multiplying all the relevant probabilities.
Using this method, we label the Mushroom_Test data and obtain the following confusion matrix.

The reported accuracy due to the high turbulence matrix will be 99.42%.
