# Fifth Project 
In this project, we attempt to implement a naive Bayes on a mushroom dataset to determine whether a new sample of mushrooms is poisonous or not. 
Then a theoretic solution for a model-based reinforcement learning problem is represented. After that, we work on implementing a reinforcement learning with and without reward to check the effect of this parameter.
