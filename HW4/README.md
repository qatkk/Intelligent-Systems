# Fourth Project 
In this project, we first theoretically compute the k-neighborhood method along with the single link to get a solid understanding of how these methods work. Further, we implement the K-neighborhood algorithm and check its performance. 
We analyze how different parameters affect this algorithm and uncover the best way to find the best K for a given dataset. 
Then, in the third part of this project, we implement a semi-supervised algorithm to improve the performance of a supervised algorithm when we have missing data. 
In the end, a basic probabilistic problem is given for introduction to the use of probabilistic methods in machine learning.
