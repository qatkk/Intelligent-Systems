# Introduction to Probabillistic Methods in Machine Learning 

## Birthday Paradox 
The birth issue is how likely it is that there will be at least one pair of people with the same birthday at a party with n people. In this case, it is assumed that the probability of birth is equal to each day of the year and is uniform, and the required probability is calculated.
Thus, it is intuitively expected that the number required for a definite event to occur would be large, but according to simulations and calculations, if the number of people in a party is more than 60, there is a probability of at least one at least one pair of similar birthday guests.

According to the probability theorem, the probability of the requested event can be calculated by repeating the experiment in large numbers and calculating the number of times the desired event has occurred. Thus, in this part, the sampling is repeated 1000 times and each time the probability of a positive event is calculated.

## Central Theorem 

According to the central limit theorem, if we take a large number of samples of independent and similar random variables (iid) and calculate their average, these means have a distribution similar to the normal distribution.
Similarly, the mean for the sample of samples is equal to the average of the samples and their variance can be calculated according to the following formula.

$$std' = \frac {\sigma}{\sqrt n}$$ 
 In this section, we want to check the accuracy of this theorem and report our calculations for two series of binomial and exponential random variables.

- Exponential random variable

The values reported in previous table are for 1000 samples, which provide the correct values for variance and mean.
The distribution of means is also visible in figure below, which is for repetitions of 10, 40, 70 and 100, respectively, which in the highest number of repetitions is more similar to the normal graph.

- Binomial random variable

The values reported in previous table were for the number of 1000 samples, which provided the correct values for the mean and variance, which, as expected, was equal to the variance of the samples divided by the number of samples, which in this example was 1000.
The distribution of means is also visible in figure below, which is for repetitions of 10, 40, 70 and 100, respectively, which in the highest number of repetitions is more similar to the normal graph.
