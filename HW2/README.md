# Second Project 

## Decision Trees
In this project, we implement decision trees from scratch using two different methods, information gain, and ID3. Using the provided prison dataset, we build the trees. This dataset has multiple attributes, including fiscal year released, recidivism reporting year, age at release, convicting offense classification, convicting offense subtype, release type, part of the target population, and the label is recidivism. 
This data represents 15425 samples of prisoners with the mentioned attributes, and the goal for this classification is whether the prisoner will commit another crime to be sent back to the prison as the last attribute, recidivism.
